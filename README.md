# My-portfolio
## This is a portfolio about myself!
I really like how I can see the progress of my work be returned in the product of my portfolio. 
I just added javascript to show some new knowledge we've gained since the last time of updating this profile.
More things to come is a carousel to show my current favorite artists and have the ability to play each song on each carousel slide.
A third window is there just in case I have an AMAZING idea to implement hehe....
