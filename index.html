            <hr>

            <div class=" card-body bg-warning "></div>
            <div class="media">

                <div class="media-body px-3">
                    <p>I am the embodiment of what it means to be a nerd, majority of my life taking place through my
                        computer.
                        However, I enjoy hobbies that take place outside my comfort place. I'm a big fan of
                        roller-blading,
                        exploring the outdoors and taking trips to places I haven't yet been to!</p>
                    <p>To describe me, I am a positive person at my foundation. I try to support everyone around me and
                        spread
                        happiness and love anywhere I step foot. I try to be a leader where necessary and pay attention
                        to those who
                        direct and lead as well. I have learned to reach for my goals and to embrace the challenges I
                        face along the
                        way, to not let the fog of the unknown deter me from what I know I'm capable of achieving. </p>
                    <p>I'm tied very close to my immediate family, especially my siblings whom I have learned much
                        after. As the
                        youngest child in the family, I've grown to understand that I can take in experiences of those
                        around me and
                        let that morph my future in a beneficial way that I see fit. This does not mean I'm afraid to
                        take on
                        failures of my own, as I have learned in the last couple of years that I shouldn't be scared of
                        myself
                        failing or be afraid of new things to come that I am unsure of. After all that is a part of the
                        excitment we
                        call life, isn't it?</p>
                    <p>As a final note, I view my life as a way to deliver those around me positive change. I want to be
                        the
                        change I want to see in the world, so I put myself in the position to help as many as I can. We
                        all have
                        different life experiences, but that does not mean we have to take on those issues alone. I
                        choose to live
                        my life out in this fashion for there are some who don't get to experience positivity in their
                        life, at
                        least on a daily basis. </p>
